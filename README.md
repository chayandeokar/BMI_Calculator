# BMI_Calculator
## BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a widely used measurement that helps assess a person's body weight relative to their height. It is a simple calculation based on weight (in kilograms) divided by the square of height (in meters). The formula for BMI is:

BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))

BMI is commonly used to categorize individuals into different weight status categories, providing a general indication of whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
